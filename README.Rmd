`rexpect` is an R package that allows you to automate interactions with programs that
expose a text terminal interface. The API is inspired by the original Expect tool by Don Libes.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jeroenjanssens/rexpect")
```


## Example

Let's say we have a Python script that repeatedly asks for a number.
When the user enters `sum`, the script prints the sum of all the numbers.
The script exits when the user presses `CTRL-C`. 
Here's the contents of _bin/sum.py_:

```{verbatim, file = "bin/sum.py", lang = "python"}
```

We can use `rexpect` to run this script and interact with it.
Let's enter the numbers 7, 13, and 22 and see what the sum is:

```{r}
library(rexpect)

session <- spawn("bin/sum.py", prompt = "^(.*):$")
send_lines(session, c("7", "13", "22", "sum"), wait = TRUE)
```

Under the hood, `rexpect` starts a tmux session using [tmuxr](https://jeroenjanssens.github.io/tmuxr):

```{r}
session
```

We can capture the output and extract the sum:

```{r}
print(output <- read_all(session))
as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9.]", "", output[length(output) - 1]))
```

We've accomplished our goal, so let's exit:

```{r}
send_lines(session, "exit")
read_all(session)
```

Oh that's right, we need to press `CTRL-C` to exit the script:

```{r}
send_control_c(session)
```

This was a rather simple example to demonstrate some of the capabilities of `rexpect`.
The session could have taken place inside a Docker container or over SSH. 
We could also have recorded the session using [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/).
